    <h3>Devoloper Bio</h3>
    <p>
        I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.

                If you’re reading this sentence, you owe a debt to Ada Lovelace. Despite being born more than a century before the development of the first commercial computer, and more than 150 years before the first consumer computer, Ada was a key figure in computer history. In fact, many have dubbed her the world’s first computer programmer.

Ada was born to Lady Anne and the famous poet Lord Byron on December 10th, 1815. Ada was Lord
